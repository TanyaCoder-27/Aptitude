## **📖 Profit & Loss Shortcut Revision Notes** 🎯  

### **1️⃣ Formula for Equal Profit & Loss Percentages**  
📌 **If one item has X% profit and another has X% loss**, use:  
\[
\text{Net Loss Percentage} = \frac{x^2}{100}
\]  
**Example:**  
If profit = 10% and loss = 10%,  
\[
\text{Net Loss} = \frac{10^2}{100} = 1\%
\]

---

### **2️⃣ Quick Trick to Find Cost Price & Selling Price**  
📌 Convert **profit percentage into a fraction**, where:  
\[
X\% = \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}
\]  
🔹 **Example:** If **profit % = 20**,  
\[
20/100 = 2/10
\]  
- **Profit = 2**  
- **Cost Price = 10**  
- **Selling Price = 12**  

So, if you know the percentage, you can quickly **find CP & SP without complex calculations**!

### **3️⃣ Net Profit/Loss Formula for Two Items Sold at the Same Selling Price**  
📌 **If one item has profit % and the other has loss %, use:**  
\[
\frac{100 \times (\text{Profit} - \text{Loss}) - 2 \times \text{Profit} \times \text{Loss}}{(100 + \text{Profit}) + (100 - \text{Loss})}
\]  

🔹 **Modifications:**  
✅ **If both items have profits**, replace **"-Loss"** with **"+Profit"**.  
✅ **If both items have losses**, replace **"+Profit"** with **"-Loss"**.

---

### **4️⃣ CPS & CLS Method**  
📌 **Used when selling price OR cost price is the same for both items.**  
✅ **CPS** → Cost Price, Profit, Selling Price (when profit is involved).  
✅ **CLS** → Cost Price, Loss, Selling Price (when loss is involved).

### **5️⃣ Shortcut Formula for Finding Cost Price When One-Third & Two-Thirds of an Item Are Sold at Different Profit Percentages**  
\[
\text{CP} = \frac{\text{Total Profit} \times 100}{\left( \frac{1}{3} \times X \right) + \left( \frac{2}{3} \times Y \right)}
\]  

📌 **If loss instead of profit**, replace **+₹ (profit amount)** with **-₹ (loss amount)** and **+X% or +Y%** with **-X% or -Y%**.

---

### **6️⃣ Shortcut Formula for Cost Price When Selling Price Changes Due to Profit Percentage Shift**  
📌 **To find CP when profit changes:**  
\[
\text{CP} = \frac{\text{Difference in Selling Price}}{\text{Difference in Profit %}} \times 100
\]  

🔹 **Example:**  
If a shopkeeper sells an item at **12% profit** and would have earned **18% profit** if sold for ₹12 more:  
\[
\text{CP} = \frac{12}{18 - 12} \times 100 = 200
\]  
So, **Cost Price = ₹200**.

✅ **If one case has profit and the other has loss**, use **Loss % as negative** when calculating **difference in profit**.  

---

### **7️⃣ Shortcut Formula for Selling Price When Profit/Loss Changes**  
📌 **To find Selling Price when profit/loss changes:**  
\[
\text{SP} = \frac{(\text{Difference in Selling Price}) \times (100 \pm \text{Profit/Loss %})}{\text{Difference in Profit %}}
\]  

🔹 **Example:**  
A shopkeeper sells a tabla at **5% loss**. Had he sold it for **₹375 more**, he would have made **10% profit**.  
Find **Selling Price for 15% profit**:  
\[
\text{SP} = \frac{375 \times (100 + 15)}{15}
\]  
\[
= \frac{375 \times 115}{15} = 2875
\]  
So, **Selling Price for 15% profit = ₹2875**.  

✅ **If profit & loss are given**, take **Loss % as negative** in calculations.

### **8️⃣ Shortcut Formula for Total Profit % When Weight is Reduced**  
📌 **To find Total Profit % when weight is reduced:**  
\[
\text{Total Profit %} = \frac{\text{Profit %} + \text{Decrease in Weight %}}{100 - \text{Decrease in Weight %}} \times 100
\]  

🔹 **Example:**  
A shopkeeper sells **potatoes at 10% profit** but **uses 20% less weight** while selling.  

\[
\text{Total Profit %} = \frac{10 + 20}{100 - 20} \times 100
\]

\[
= \frac{30}{80} \times 100
\]

\[
= 37.5\%
\]  

So, **his actual profit = 37.5%** instead of just 10%!  

📌 **Fun Fact:** 🤭 **There is no case of loss in weight reduction scenarios—because using less weight only increases profit!**  

---

### **9️⃣ Modified Formula for Weight Reduction Cases When Selling at Cost Price**  
📌 **If selling at cost price (0% profit), substitute 0 in the formula:**  
\[
\text{Total Profit %} = \frac{0 + \text{Decrease in Weight %}}{100 - \text{Decrease in Weight %}} \times 100
\]  

🔹 **Example:**  
A shopkeeper sells **potatoes at cost price** but uses **20% less weight**:  
\[
\text{Total Profit %} = \frac{0 + 20}{100 - 20} \times 100
\]

\[
= \frac{20}{80} \times 100
\]

\[
= 25\%
\]  

So, **even at cost price, actual profit = 25%!**  

✅ **Again, no case of loss here—only hidden profit!** 🚀😆
