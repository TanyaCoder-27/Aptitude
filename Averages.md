# **📖 Average – Comprehensive Revision Notes** 🎯  

### **1️⃣ Understanding Average**  
✅ **Formula for Average:**  
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all terms}}{\text{Number of terms}}
\]  

The average of a set of numbers represents the **equal distribution** of values across all terms.  

📌 **Key Insight:**  
- The **sum** is the most crucial element in calculating the average.  
- Always find the total sum first and then divide by the total count.

### **2️⃣ Finding the Average of First 8 Squares**  

📌 **Formula for the sum of first \( n \) squares:**  
\[
S = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]  

✅ **Step 1:** Calculate the sum of the first 8 squares using the formula:  
\[
S = \frac{8(8+1)(2 \times 8 + 1)}{6}
\]  
\[
= \frac{8 \times 9 \times 17}{6} = \frac{1224}{6} = 204
\]  

✅ **Step 2:** Find the **average** by dividing by \( n = 8 \):  
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{204}{8} = 25.5
\]  

📌 **Final Answer:** **Average of first 8 squares is 25.5** 🚀

### **3️⃣ Finding the Average of First \( n \) Odd Numbers**  

📌 **Shortcut Formula:**  
✅ **Average of first \( n \) odd numbers = \( n \) itself**  

🔹 **Example:** Find the **average of the first 75 odd numbers**.  
\[
\text{Average} = 75
\]  

📌 **Sum of First \( n \) Odd Numbers:**  
\[
\text{Sum} = n^2
\]  

🔹 **Example:** For the first 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9):  
\[
\text{Sum} = 5^2 = 25
\]  

✅ **Key Insight:** The sum of \( n \) odd numbers is always a perfect square, making calculations easy.

---

### **4️⃣ Finding the Average of First \( n \) Even Numbers**  

📌 **Shortcut Formula:**  
✅ **Average of first \( n \) even numbers = \( n+1 \)**  

🔹 **Example:** Find the **average of the first 10 even numbers**.  
\[
\text{Average} = 10 + 1 = 11
\]  

📌 **Sum of First \( n \) Even Numbers:**  
\[
\text{Sum} = n(n+1)
\]  

🔹 **Example:** For the first 6 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12):  
\[
\text{Sum} = 6(6+1) = 6 \times 7 = 42
\]  

✅ **Key Insight:** The sum grows linearly, making calculations simpler for larger values.  

---

### **5️⃣ Average of an Arithmetic Progression (AP)**  

📌 **Shortcut Formula:**  
✅ **Average of an AP series = \(\frac{\text{First Term} + \text{Last Term}}{2}\)**  

🔹 **Example:** Find the **average of the next 21 consecutive numbers starting from 21**.  

✅ **Solution:**  
\[
\text{First Term} = 21, \text{Last Term} = 21 + 21 - 1 = 41
\]  
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{21 + 41}{2} = \frac{62}{2} = 31
\]  

📌 **Why it works:** This shortcut is derived from the sum formula of an AP sequence:  
\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (\text{First Term} + \text{Last Term})
\]  
Dividing by \( n \) gives the average directly.  

✅ **Key Insight:** Use this to calculate averages of consecutive numbers efficiently.

### **6️⃣ Weighted Average Formula**  

📌 **Formula:**  
\[
\text{Weighted Average} = \frac{(n_1 \times A_1) + (n_2 \times A_2) + \dots}{n_1 + n_2 + \dots}
\]  

Where:  
- \( n_1, n_2, \dots \) are the respective counts or weights.  
- \( A_1, A_2, \dots \) are the respective averages.

🔹 **Example:** A class of 20 students has an average score of 75, and another class of 30 students has an average score of 85. Find the combined average:  
\[
\text{Weighted Average} = \frac{(20 \times 75) + (30 \times 85)}{20 + 30}
\]  
\[
= \frac{1500 + 2550}{50} = \frac{4050}{50} = 81
\]  

📌 **Final Answer:** The combined average score is **81**.

### **7️⃣ Key Shortcut Tricks for Average Problems**  

📌 **For consecutive numbers:**  
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{First Term} + \text{Last Term}}{2}
\]  
This works for evenly spaced sequences (arithmetic progressions).  

📌 **Handling Missing Numbers:**  
If a number is missing in an average problem, use:  
\[
\text{Missing Number} = \text{New Average} \times \text{Total Count} - \text{Sum of Available Numbers}
\]  

📌 **Weighted Average Concept:**  
Great for combining averages across groups with different sizes or weights.  

📌 **Fractional(Parts) Average Concept:**   If given average of 6 numbers, and then average of first two, and next two and you have to find average of last two numbers, it would be simple with the formula of: (avg of first two + avg of middle two + avg of last two)/3 = total avg
