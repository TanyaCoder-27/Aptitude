### **1️⃣ Volume Formulas**  
- **Cylinder**  
- **Cone**  

### **2️⃣ Property of Equal Ratios**  
### **3️⃣ Modified Property with Coefficients**  
### **4️⃣ Duplicate Ratio**  
### **5️⃣ Sub-Duplicate Ratio**  
### **6️⃣ Triplicate Ratio**  
### **7️⃣ Sub-Triplicate Ratio**  
### **8️⃣ Inverse/Reverse Ratio**  
### **9️⃣ Compound Ratio**  
### **🔟 Finding Ratios When One Value is More Than Another**  

### **11️⃣ Padosa Technique**  
#### **Padosa Horizon** *(To be described later)*  

### **12️⃣ Componendo & Dividendo Rule**  
📌 **Formula:**  
If  
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
\]  
Then:  
\[
\frac{a + b}{a - b} = \frac{c + d}{c - d}
\]  
✅ **Useful for simplifying ratio-based problems!**  

### **13️⃣ Convertendo Property**  
📌 **Formula:**  
If  
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
\]  
Then:  
\[
\frac{a}{a - b} = \frac{c}{c - d}
\]  
✅ **Useful in solving proportions efficiently!**  

### **14️⃣ Product of Extremes Property**  
📌 **Formula:**  
If  
\[
a : b :: c : d
\]  
Then:  
\[
a \times d = b \times c
\]  

### **15️⃣ Continuous Proportion**  
📌 **If \( a, b, c \) are in continuous proportion**, then:  
✅ **Mean Proportion**:  
\[
b = \sqrt{a \times c}
\]  
✅ **Third Proportion**:  
\[
c = \frac{b^2}{a}
\]  

### **16️⃣ Income & Expenditure Ratio Question**  
📌 **Problem Statement:**  
The ratio of incomes of A & B is **3:5**, and the ratio of expenditures is **1:2**. If each saves **₹4000**, find the incomes of A & B.  

✅ **Shortcut Trick:**  
- **Cross multiplication results denominator**  
- **Expenditure difference is numerator**  
- **Numerator × Savings**  
- **Multiply by 3 → Income of A**  
- **Multiply by 5 → Income of B**  
- **Calculate the final ratio**  

📌 **Final Answer:**  
✅ **A’s Income** = ₹12,000  
✅ **B’s Income** = ₹20,000  

### **17️⃣ Comparing Ratios**  
📌 **Method:**  
1. **Find the LCM of denominators**.  
2. **Adjust both fractions** to have the same denominator.  
3. **Compare numerators** to determine which ratio is greater or smaller.  

### **18️⃣ PDSD Method – Finding the Value to Make Numbers Proportional**  
📌 **Question:**  
What should be added to each of **5, 9, 11, 18** to make them proportional?  

✅ **Shortcut Trick:**  
1️⃣ Pair **smallest & largest** → **(5,18)**  
2️⃣ Pair **remaining two** → **(9,11)**  
3️⃣ **Numerator** = \( (9 \times 11) - (5 \times 18) \)  
4️⃣ **Denominator** = \( (9 + 11) - (5 + 18) \)  
5️⃣ Final answer = **+3**  

### **19️⃣ Ratio of Sum & Difference of Two Numbers**  
📌 **Question:**  
The ratio of the **sum and difference** of two numbers is **9:2**. Find the ratio of these numbers using **Componendo & Dividendo**.  

✅ **Shortcut Solution:**  
Applying Componendo & Dividendo:  
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{11}{7}
\]  
✅ **Final Answer** = **Ratio of numbers is 11:7!**  

### **20️⃣ Some Very Basic Common Sense Questions**  
📌 **1️⃣ What should be subtracted from each term of 15:19 so that the new ratio becomes 3:4?**  
📌 **2️⃣ What should be added to each term of 9:16 so that the new ratio becomes 2:3?**  

### **21️⃣ Income Formula**  
✅ **Income = Savings + Expenditure**  

📌 **Question:**  
The ratio of income of **Priyanka Chopra** and **Hrithik Roshan** is **3:4**. The ratio of their expenditures is **4:5**. Find the ratio of their savings if Priyanka’s savings are **one-fourth** of her income.  

### **22️⃣ Key Note on Solving Ratio & Proportion Problems**  
📌 **Solving ratio-based problems (especially salary-related ones) involves forming equations step by step based on what we need!**
