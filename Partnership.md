# **📖 Partnership – Comprehensive Revision Notes** 🎯  

### **1️⃣ Understanding Partnership**  
✅ **Formula for Profit Calculation:**  
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Investment} \times \text{Time}
\]  

In a partnership, profit is distributed among partners based on their investments and the duration of their contributions.  

---

### **2️⃣ Simple Partnership vs. Compound Partnership**  

📌 **Simple Partnership:**  
- If **time duration is equal** for all partners, the profit ratio is directly based on their **investments**.  
- Formula:  
\[
\text{Profit Sharing Ratio} = I_1 : I_2 : I_3 \dots
\]  

📌 **Compound Partnership:**  
- If **time duration varies**, the profit ratio is calculated using **Investment × Time**.  
- Formula:  
\[
\text{Profit Sharing Ratio} = (I_1 \times T_1) : (I_2 \times T_2) : (I_3 \times T_3) \dots
\]  

✅ **Shortcut Trick:**  
To easily calculate profit ratio:  
1️⃣ Find the **Investment Ratio** first.  
2️⃣ Find the **Time Ratio** next.  
3️⃣ Multiply both to get the **Profit Ratio**.  

\[
\text{Profit Ratio} = \text{Investment Ratio} \times \text{Time Ratio}
\]

### **3️⃣ STAR Problem – Profit Sharing with Charity Deduction 🌟**  

📌 **Question:**  
A and B invest in a business in the **ratio of 3:2**. After **5% of the total profit** is donated to charity, A receives **₹855** as his share. Find the **total profit before donation**.

---

### **📌 Solution:**  

✅ **Step 1:** Since the **investment ratio is 3:2**, and both partners invested for the **same time duration**, this is a case of **Simple Partnership**. The **profit ratio** is directly equal to their **investment ratio**:  
\[
3 : 2
\]  

📌 **Note:**  
Here, **Investment Ratio = Profit Ratio** because the time invested by both partners is the same.

✅ **Step 2:** After the 5% donation to charity, the remaining profit is:  
\[
P_{\text{remaining}} = 95\% \times P_{\text{total}}
\]  
A’s share of the remaining profit is **₹855**, which is based on his profit ratio of **3/5**.  

We use the formula:  
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times P_{\text{remaining}} = 855
\]  

Rearranging to find \( P_{\text{remaining}} \):  
\[
P_{\text{remaining}} = \frac{855 \times 5}{3} = \frac{4275}{3} = 1425
\]  

✅ **Step 3:** The **remaining profit (₹1425)** represents **95% of the total profit**. To find the total profit \( P_{\text{total}} \):  
\[
P_{\text{total}} = \frac{P_{\text{remaining}}}{95\%} = \frac{1425}{95} \times 100
\]  

\[
P_{\text{total}} = 1500
\]  

✅ **Step 4:** Validate the approach: The total profit (₹1500) is split as follows:  
- **5% for charity:**  
  \[
  5\% \times 1500 = 75
  \]  
- **Remaining profit:**  
  \[
  95\% \times 1500 = 1425
  \]  
- **A’s share:**  
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 1425 = 855 \quad \text{(Correct!)}
  \]  

---

### **📌 Final Answer:**  
The **total profit before donation is ₹1500**. 🚀

### **4️⃣ Key Shortcut Tricks for Partnership Problems**  

✅ **Profit Distribution Formula:**  
\[
\text{Profit Ratio} = \text{Investment Ratio} \times \text{Time Ratio}
\]  
This method ensures quick calculation by breaking it into simple steps.  

✅ **Handling Charity or Deductions:**  
- If **X% of profit** is deducted before distribution, calculate profit as:  
\[
P_{\text{remaining}} = \left( 1 - \frac{X}{100} \right) \times P_{\text{total}}
\]  
Then apply ratios to split the remaining profit.  

✅ **New Partner Joining Late:**  
- If a new partner joins after **T** months, use their investment multiplied by their time duration to include them in the profit-sharing.
