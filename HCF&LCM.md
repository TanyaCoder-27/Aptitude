# **📖 HCF & LCM – Comprehensive Revision Notes** 🎯  

### **1️⃣ What Are HCF & LCM?**  

📌 **HCF (Highest Common Factor):**  
The largest number that divides two or more numbers **without leaving a remainder**.  

📌 **LCM (Least Common Multiple):**  
The smallest number that is a **multiple of two or more numbers**.  

---

### **2️⃣ Fact Connecting HCF & LCM**  

📌 **HCF × LCM = n₁ × n₂**  
Where \( n₁ \) and \( n₂ \) are the given numbers.  

---

### **3️⃣ Techniques to Find HCF & LCM**  

#### **1️⃣ Prime Factorization Method:**  

✅ **To find HCF:**  
- Simply take the product of **common factors** with their **least powers**.  

✅ **To find LCM:**  
- Simply take the product of **all factors** with their **highest powers**.  

---

#### **2️⃣ Division Methods:**  

✅ **Longest Division Method for HCF:**  
- A step-by-step division process to find the **highest factor** dividing the two numbers.  

✅ **Division Method for LCM:**  
- Divide the numbers by their **common prime factors** until only 1s remain, then multiply all the divisors.

### **4️⃣ SHOT TRICK for HCF of n numbers:**  
- Pick the **smallest number** (say \( x \)) among the \( n \) numbers.  
- Check if \( x \) is a **common factor** for all the remaining numbers.  
- If \( x \) is not a common factor, proceed to check **all factors of \( x \)** one by one, starting with its **next highest factor** (say \( y \)).  
- Continue this process until **all factors of \( x \)** have been checked.  
- If none of the factors of \( x \) satisfy as common factors for all the given \( n \) numbers, the **HCF will be 1** absolutely.  

---

### **5️⃣ SHOT TRICK for LCM of n numbers:**  
- Pick the **highest number** (say \( x \)) among the given \( n \) numbers.  
- Check if \( x \) is a **common multiple** of all other numbers.  
- If \( x \) is a common multiple, it is the **LCM**.  
- If not, proceed to the **next multiple** of \( x \) (say \( y \)) and check if \( y \) is the **common multiple** of all other numbers.  
- If no common multiple is found through this process, **multiply all the numbers** to get the LCM.  

📌 **Special Note:**  
If **2 consecutive numbers** are given:  
- Their **HCF is always 1**.  
- Their **LCM is their product**.  

---

### **6️⃣ HCF of Decimals:**  
To find the **HCF of decimals**:  
- Convert the decimals into **whole numbers** by multiplying by 10, 100, or 1000 (depending on the number of decimal places in the given numbers).  
- Then, find the **HCF of the resulting whole numbers** using your preferred method.  

---

### **7️⃣ HCF & LCM of Fractions:**  

📌 **To find the HCF of fractions:**  
\[
\text{HCF of fractions} = \frac{\text{HCF of numerators}}{\text{LCM of denominators}}
\]  

📌 **To find the LCM of fractions:**  
\[
\text{LCM of fractions} = \frac{\text{LCM of numerators}}{\text{HCF of denominators}}
\]
