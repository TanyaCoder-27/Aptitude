# **📖 Probability – Comprehensive Revision Notes** 🎯  

### **1️⃣ Understanding Probability**  
📌 **Definition:**  
Probability measures how **likely** an event is to occur. It ranges between **0 and 1**, where:  
- **0** → The event is **impossible**  
- **1** → The event is **certain**  

📌 **Basic Formula:**  
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Possible Outcomes}}
\]  

✅ **Example:**  
If a fair die is rolled, the probability of getting **a 4** is:  
\[
\frac{1}{6}
\]

### **2️⃣ Types of Probability**  

📌 **Classical Probability (Mathematical Probability):**  
Used in games, dice, coins, and cards where outcomes are **equally likely**.  

📌 **Empirical Probability (Experimental Probability):**  
Based on **observations** or **experiments** instead of equal likelihoods.  

📌 **Subjective Probability:**  
Based on **personal judgment or experience** (e.g., predicting a sports team's chances of winning).

### **3️⃣ Key Probability Formulas**  

✅ **Complementary Rule:**  
If event \( A \) has probability \( P(A) \), then the probability of **A not happening** is:  
\[
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
\]  

✅ **Addition Rule (For Mutually Exclusive Events):**  
If two events **cannot happen together**, the probability of either occurring is:  
\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
\]  

✅ **Multiplication Rule (For Independent Events):**  
If events **don’t affect each other**, the probability of both occurring is:  
\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\]

### **4️⃣ Shortcut Trick for Even & Odd Numbers**  

📌 **Rules:**  
- **Even × Any × Any = Even**  
- **Even + Even = Even**  
- **Odd + Odd = Even**  
- **Remaining cases result in Odd**

### **5️⃣ ⭐ STAR Problem – Probability of Exactly One Letter Being Incorrect 🌟**  

📌 **Question:**  
A typist types **42 letters** and addresses **42 envelopes**, then inserts each letter randomly into an envelope (1 letter per envelope). What is the probability that **exactly one letter is placed in an improper envelope**?  

📌 **Solution:**  

✅ **Step 1:** Total arrangements of letters into envelopes:  
\[
42!
\]  

✅ **Step 2:** Checking feasibility of exactly one improper placement:  
For **exactly one letter** to be incorrect:  
- One letter is in the wrong envelope.  
- All other 41 letters are correct.  

This is **impossible**, as the last letter will always be forced to match correctly once 41 correct placements are made.  

✅ **Conclusion:**  
Such an arrangement cannot exist. Therefore, the probability is:  
\[
\mathbf{0}
\]

### **7️⃣ Permutation & Combination – Rules & Formulas**  

📌 **Permutation (Ordered Arrangement):**  
- Formula:  
\[
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
\]  

📌 **Combination (Selection Only):**  
- Formula:  
\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]  

---

#### **Arrangements With Repetition**  

✅ **Permutation (With Repetition):**  
\[
n^r
\]  

✅ **Combination (With Repetition):**  
\[
C_{\text{rep}}(n, r) = \frac{(n + r - 1)!}{r!(n - 1)!}
\]

#### **Special Cases**  

📌 **Unique Items (n!):**  
\[

\]  

📌 **Repeating Items:**  
\[
\frac{n!}{a! \times b! \times c! \dots}
\]  

📌 **Circular Permutation:**  
\[
